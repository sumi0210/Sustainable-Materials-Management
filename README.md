Python Scraping and Data Analysis

This is an exploratory data analysis project that involves some simple web scraping to obtain tables from a government / public sector website. The purpose of the project is to obtain data from a website source, and to further analyze the data for the researcher's needs. Often in health and other government organizations, such as the CDC, EPA, etc, data can come in different forms, and it is not always available in downloadable csv format (for example, it may be in an html format). In that case, the researcher can use a statistical programming language and / or related applications such as R or Python, to download and then analyze the data.

The data to be analyzed in this project, comes from the EPA (Environmental Protection Agency). Solid waste planners and organizations collect and analyze data such as greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to understand the benefits that various waste management programs are adding to the environment and to the economy. The metric that is analyzed here is the MMTCO2E, which is the million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent metric, to analyze how much of greenhouse gas emissions can be reduced using the various alternative waste management programs, compared to the baseline. The various waste management practices include recycling, composting, combustion with energy renewal, and landfilling.

Also, provided, is a variable that shows the MMTCO2E metric as comparison to the equivalent number of vehicle emissions saved per year.
